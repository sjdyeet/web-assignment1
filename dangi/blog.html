        <h2>Aims and objective:</h2>
        <p>The main goal of making this website was to enhance and broaden the knowledge 
            we learned in class from the teacher. We learnt a lot about building websites 
            today, and we will continue to learn more in the future.</p>

        <h2>Beginning of the assignment:</h2>
        <p>Although the beginning was more difficult than I had anticipated, I did my 
            best to create a page that looked decent and provided information. In order 
            to gain more ideas and tips for building a quality website, I did seek some 
            assistance from the more experienced individuals and watched several online 
            videos.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card_3">
        <h2>Conclusion of the assignment:</h2>
        <p>Finally, I've developed a webpage that I think is quite decent considering 
            I'm just learning how to use the internet and computers. This page is just 
            the beginning; I plan to add more and learn more in the coming years.</p>
